                <p>The <em>Rhythm Engine</em> is a presentation of a continuous
                multi-dimensional rhythmic space, originally designed by Pete
                Kellock in the mid nineties at ISS, Singapore.</p>

                <p>The engine performs rhythms using a number of
                <em>voices</em>, each playing the role of a single drum. What
                each voice does can be controlled by a bunch of continuous
                sliders. A number of voices playing a few different drums can
                make interesting rhythm patterns that you can manipulate at a
                high level using this interface.</p>

                <h3>Presets and the morpher</h3>

                <p>When you arrive at a set of voices and slider settings for
                them that you like, you can save it in one of the "presets".
                Just click on one of them.</p>

                <p>The presets you store can be used in the "morpher" and you
                can explore the space <em>between</em> your presets by
                manipulating the red handle in the morpher.</p>

                <p>You can drag any green preset into a morph to include it in
                the mix. To remove it, shift-click on the preset within the
                morpher. Thereafter, while the rhythm is playing, you can
                manipulate the red morpher handle to move in the space between
                your presets in a limited way (it's a 2D morpher after all).</p>

                <h3>Voice controls</h3>

                <p>A very brief description of the controls follow. This is
                just a rough guide. Have fun playing with them and figuring out
                how to make interesting stuff with them instead of reading this
                :)</p>

                    <dt>phase</dt>
                    <dd>Time shifts the pattern being generated by the voice according
                    to a sense of "progressive weirdness". </dd>

                    <dt>straight</dt>
                    <dd>Increasing this will result in a normal straight 4/4 kind of beat 
                    pattern.</dd>

                    <dt>offbeat</dt>
                    <dd>Increasing this will cause strokes on cycle times that are 
                    offbeat relative to the "straight" pattern.</dd>

                    <dt>funk</dt>
                    <dd>A pattern of the form 3+3+3+3+2+2.</dd>

                    <dd>Amount of randomness in the pattern.</dd>

                    <dt>ramp</dt>
                    <dd>Increasing this will cause the voice to ramp up during the cycle.</dd>

                    <dt>threshold</dt>
                    <dd>The above sliders determine the "strike velocity" of the drum.
                    This parameter specifies which values of the resultant velocity will
                    be discarded. Only values above this threshold will be audible.</dd>

                    <dd>Am ordinary volume control on the voice.</dd>

                <h3>Technical info</h3>

                <p>This implementation makes use of a bunch of bleeding edge
                browser technologies. Frankly, it is a pleasure to see all
                these work together fairly well and I didn't bleed all that
                much.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The Web Audio API for all the sound heavy lifting.</li>
                    <li>2D Canvas API for the slider and morpher controls.</li>
                    <li><code>window.localStorage</code></li>
                    <li>FileSystem and Quota APIs for cached drum sample storage.</li>
                    <li>Drag-n-drop API for working with presets.</li>
                    <li><code>requestAnimationFrame</code> for timing, though this is only
                    temporary. It doesn't provide enough audio accuracy and I'll
                    likely switch to a JavascriptAudioNode to do the timing instead.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>TODO</h3>

                <p>This implementation doesn't include all elements of the
                original Rhythm Engine. Here's what's been left out.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Swing parameter</li>
                    <li>Time signature needs to be exposed in the UI.</li>
                    <li>Simple/Comound time structure needs to be exposed in the UI.</li>
                    <li>Chords! The engine is most fun when it also plays chord patterns and 
                    I need instrument samples for use with the web audio api. (rant)Damn,
                    some things are just easier with MIDI.(/rant)</li>
                    <li>Lonce Wyse has made some improvements to the RE in the area 
                    of swing. Yet to incorporate those.</li>
                    <li>The morpher won't work with only one preset in the scene.
                    This situation was called "z-morphing" or "morphing to zero" in the
                    original RE. This is to be handled with everything going to zero
                    as the morpher gets more distant from the sole preset (plus a few details). 
                    That isn't implemented yet.</li>
